# Personal Portfolio v1
## Working in Progress (WIP) ðŸš§

This website was built using [Astro](https://astro.build)
Because of Astro the website can be built using any frameworks (Svelte, Vue.js, React, Preact, Solid JS), and only partially rendered the components on the client side while keeping the other part of the website static. This is possible because of [Partial Hydration](https://docs.astro.build/core-concepts/component-hydration/) feature, which is one of the special features provided by Astro.

I've built some simple project from freeCodeCamp using several frameworks while keeping it under the same project (this project).

Technologies Used:
- Astro
- Tailwind CSS
